# isc-workflow-repository

Repository with workflows and forms for specific use cases

# Governance Groups Management

Workflows and forms to delegate to the governance group owner, the management of its groups. With that workflow, the owner can now remove members

# Track my requests

The idea of the workflow is to provide an interactive way, for an end user, to get details about its pending access request. The user can search for its request and get details about the status, the approver(s) and, if necessary, send reminders to the approvers.

# Welcome package for joiners

The workflow is trigger after an identity is created. The workflow will simply ask the manager about the computer and mobile phone to be assigned to the joiner. Then, tickets are automatically opened in ServiceNow
